# InteractivePythagoras

InteractivePythagoras is a fun, visual tool designed to allow users to interactively explore the Pythagorean Theorem by manipulating a triangle directly in their web browser.

## Description

The tool utilizes JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas to allow users to adjust the size and shape of a triangle, thereby visually demonstrating the principle of the Pythagorean Theorem. With InteractivePythagoras, users can drag points to adjust the triangle's shape and immediately see how the theorem applies.

## Features

- **Dynamic Triangle Manipulation:** Users can adjust the size and shape of a triangle interactively.
- **Vibrant Visual Feedback:** The squares on each side of the triangle change dynamically, providing real-time visual feedback.
- **Interactive Learning:** Helps users intuitively understand the Pythagorean theorem by visualizing the square of the lengths of the sides.

## How to Use

1. **Drag Points:** Click and drag the points labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C' to adjust the triangle's shape and size.
2. **Observe Changes:** Watch the squares on each side and observe the changes in their areas as per the Pythagorean Theorem.
3. **Explore:** Try to create different types of triangles (scalene, isosceles, or equilateral) and observe the relationships between the side lengths.

## Learning Objective

- **Understand the Pythagorean Theorem:** Visualizing the relationship a² + b² = c² where 'c' is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.
- **Engage with Geometry:** An interactive way to explore basic geometric principles and develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For creating interactive functionality and manipulating the Canvas.
